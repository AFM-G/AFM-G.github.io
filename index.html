      <h3>Cavitation</h3>
      <p>The complex flow phenomenon associated with high-speed liquid-gas mixture flows, 
  especially about cavitation, is studied by using numerical simulation and experiment. 
  Additionally, advancement of fluid machinery systems with the mixture flows is investigated, 
  including the investigation of thermodynamic suppression effect of cavitation, development of
  numerical method and model for cavitation, and wake cavitation instability</p>
